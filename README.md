## Overview

The first project in the Udacity front end developer nano-degree. It is a multi page personal blog using
CSS, HTML, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and responsive design. It displays a main page containing blog posts in the
form of cards, two have linked post pages and the rest are mock examples for layout purposes. Furthermore,
a dummy contact page. The two post example pages contain dummy data that shows the use of layout and 
various html and css attributes.


## Instructions

Simply open the `index.html` file in a browser, keeping the file structure intact.


## Goals

* Complete all required sections of the project.
* Make sure the layout worked on all major screen sizes and change accordingly. E.G. The navigation changes
position completely when on larger screen sizes.
* Go beyond the requirements by creating a second post page.
* Implement a simple navigation system that allows movement between all pages.
* Making sure my code was to Udacity standards in terms of syntax, indentationa, and readability.
